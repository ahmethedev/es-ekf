# Error State Extended Kalman Filter for RTOS

This repository contains an implementation of the Error State Extended Kalman Filter (ES-EKF) algorithm in C, designed to run on a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The ES-EKF is a variant of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) used for state estimation in nonlinear systems with uncertainties.

## Features

- Implementation of the ES-EKF algorithm in C.
- Designed to run on an RTOS for real-time applications.
- Utilizes basic linear algebra operations such as dot product, identity matrix creation, and array initialization.
- Provides state estimation for nonlinear systems with uncertainties.
